The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patients information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both Demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors.\n",

Traditional methods of cardiovascular risk prediction rely on risk factors such as age, gender, and blood pressure, but these methods have limitations in accurately predicting individual risk.\n",

Though CVDs cannot be treated, predicting the risk of the disease and taking the necessary precautions and medications can help to avoid severe symptoms and, in some cases, even death. As a result, it is critical that we accurately predict the risk of heart disease in order to avert as many fatalities as possible.\n",
